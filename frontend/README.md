This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## API configuration

The reconciliation pages talk directly to the FastAPI backend. Configure the base URL via:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_FINANCE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

If the variable is omitted the app now falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and, ultimately, to `http://localhost:8001`. This keeps the UI pointing at the same port as the FastAPI instance (`uvicorn main:app --port 8001`) and avoids the 404s seen when the default pointed to `localhost:3001`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
